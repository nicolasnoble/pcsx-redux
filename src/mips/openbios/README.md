# Openbios

## Purpose of this project

There are several goals from the code in this directory.

### Educational

Writing an emulator requires extensive knowledge of the machine being emulated. The BIOS of the PlayStation is part of it, and is obviously required to boot the machine and start games. This work is done so that both the author and the reader can perfect their understanding of its internals.

As a result, the code written here tries to be as close as possible to the original, bugs, quirks and all included. You may notice some anti-patterns while reading the code, like buffer overflows or arithmetic mistakes. They are intentional, and a direct reflection of what the retail BIOS does. Some of these bugs are weird enough that it's difficult to infer the original buggy C code, while still understanding the general intend. Some of these bugs are severe enough that they have been fixed, but mentions are usually added to explain what changed and why.

Note that the generated binary will be nowhere close to the original rom this is inspired from. This is caused by several different factors: codestyle isn't identical for a start, and some optimizations have been put in place still, such as the way syscalls are being issued. Linking order will also throw off some of the mappings. And finally, today's compilers generate much smarter code than before. So the same C code won't generate the same assembly code for two different compilers. There is also some dead or duplicated code in there that'd be useless or meaningless to reproduce. Finally, the shell itself is radically different.

### Ease of distribution

While dumping an original PlayStation disc is something that is fairly easy to do for anyone using any sort of compact disc reader connected to a personal computer, dumping the bios of a retail machine, while not impossible, is a somewhat harder feat. As a result, people are often relying on bios dumps done by third party people, which ought to be considered copyright violation. Also, some emulators have a "HLE" bios, which creates a maintenance burden for each emulator, as well as being a complex mix of LLE and HLE code.

### Testing

Any recent project needs automated testing. Having source code available for all parts of the emulator will improve testing availability and test coverage, hopefully, for both the emulator, and the bios code.

## Building

The currently supported build method for this project requires docker. You can use the `dockermake.sh` script at the root of the repository as a replacement for the `make` command, and use the `Makefile` present here. The `Makefile` currently doesn't have any notion of dependency, which makes it impossible to use while actively modifying the code. Running the `clean` target is highly recommended between two builds. In all cases, this builds fairly fast. Under Windows, the `build.bat` can be used. If using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), one can use the task "make_openbios" to compile: CTRL-P then `task make_openbios` to compile.

The result of the compilation should be a file called `openbios.elf` that contains all useful debugging symbols, and a file called `openbios.bin` which can be used in emulators or even burned to a chip and placed on a retail console.

## Status

This subproject is currently under construction. OpenBIOS does almost all the same things as the retail BIOS does when booting, aside from properly setting up the memory card device. Currently, some games are booting and working properly with this code.

## Organization

The BIOS is split in two major parts: the low level code for the bios itself, and the shell, which is the binary that's being loaded into memory at boot time by the bios, to display the SONY sound and logo, and has a small utility menu for playing audio discs, or shuffling around memory cards.

While the first part is the main one that's being targeted here, the second one isn't currently present. This may change in the future, but this isn't currently the focus of this project.

The original code was most likely chunked into several sub-projects, that were all linked together like a giant patchwork. This approach is less readable, and for this reason, we're not going to do this. However this will result in the ROM/RAM split to be less obvious, and slower at times than the original. Tuning of the hot functions is eventually required.

## Direction

The primary repository for this project is going to be as a subdirectory of PCSX-Redux at the moment, because building, testing and integration as a single bloc of code is much more practical than separate repositories. If the need arise however, it should be possible to move it as a separate repository elsewhere.

## Technicalities

The code has been rewritten based off the reverse engineering of a dump of the BIOS of an american SCPH-7001 machine. MD5sum: 1e68c231d0896b7eadcad1d7d8e76129

The ghidra database for it is currently being hosted on a server, alongside a few other pieces of software being reversed. Contact one of the authors if you want access.

## Commentary

The retail PlayStation BIOS code is a constellation of bugs and bad design. The fact that the retail console boots at all is nothing short of a miracle. Half of the provided libc in the A0 table is buggy. The BIOS code is barely able to initialize the CD-Rom, and read the game's binary off of it to boot it; anything beyond that will be crippled with bugs. And this only is viable if you respect a very strict method to create your CD-Rom. The memory card and gamepad code is a steaming-hot heap of human excrement. The provided GPU stubs are inefficient at best. The only sane thing that any software running on the PlayStation ought to do is to immediately disable interrupts, grab the function pointer located at 0x00000310 for `FlushCache`, in order put it inside a wrapper that disables interrupts before calling it, and then trash the whole memory to install its own code. The only reason `FlushCache` is required from the retail code is because since the function will unplug the main memory bus off the CPU in order to work, it HAS to run from the 0xbfc memory map, which will still be connected. Anything else from the retail code is virtually useless, and shouldn't be relied upon.
